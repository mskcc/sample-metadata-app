Tables and DB Setup
    - Columns to show
        - Pipeline, confirmation?
        - PM? 

    - Patient Table
        - CMO Patient 
        - Sex
        - Species
        - MRN and CMO Patient ID should have 1:1 relationship
     
    - Sample Table
        - CMO Sample Class
        - Tissue Location
        - SpecimenType
        - TumorType
        - Preservation
        - Conservation

    - FastQ
        - one row per file? 

    - Assay Table
        - Data Ownership (PI default)    


    - Are non-humans patients? 
    



Tech Stack
    - Flask
    - MySQL
    - React (material, redux?, session tracking)

Deliverables:
- Project status, QC status

1) 

- Investigate status project tracker plugin
- Endpoint with optional timestamp parm
    - Upload/Dump (feed the DB with historical samples, patient info <2018)
    - Pull from LIMS 
    - logic to determine performed assay and parent sample, parent source igo id, parent requestid
- Database protoype 
    - Patient
    - Sample level table
    - Assay (sample can have multiple assays)
    - FastQ (to capture external, internal lives in ngs stats)
- Reuse SampleTracker 
    - Flask (implement API Response)
    - Columns by user role
    - React/Handsontable (material)
- Viewing only, editing later
- Double check columns with stakeholders (pipelines after we have PM columns)

- What is an external sample? And how can we link it if it's the same patient? How can we mark it?


2) 

- Reimplement Corrected CMO ID (using original logic doc)
- Splunk 
- Query by Columns + any additional boolean logic, wildcards, search across all columns
    - which columns would landing page search box look at? 
- Statuses (QC, Project...)
- Export
- CRDB lookup to translate anonymized ID's to MRN (limits PHI other apps have to supply)


3)
- Editing
- Cohort logic (check with Voyager)
- replace DMP
- replace SampleLevelCMOInfo tracker:
    - How would we get patient information? 
        - external source
        - how does promote know SampleLevelCMOInfo to attach to?
    => Discuss again when LIMS most recent pull is implemented and we're ready to push promote     
- Pipeline ability to publish post-analysis results (endpoint, or manual)

To be defined:


- Sample Promote will push or LIMS endpoint to get recent promoted (daily?)
- Upload (for IGO-external samples)
- Maybe at some point, use it to correct LIMS, LIMS changes won't update this

- Later on:
    - extend sources, pull from ngs stats?

Sources for pipeline kickoff:
    - LIMS (DNA input, or status)
    - Meta-DB (to be added to current pipeline endpoint)
    - ngs-stats (fastq)
